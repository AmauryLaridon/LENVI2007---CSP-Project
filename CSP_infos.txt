Parabolic trough collector : 
	-geometry : only need to determine 2 parameters out of rim angle, apertude width, focal length to determine size and shape
	-for plane receivers : rim angle of 45° for max concentration ratio but for parabolic it's around 80°
	-most collectors have 6m of apertude width and around 1.75m of focal length and module length of 12 and 14m
	-sun tracking system : preferred orientation of north-south aligment with east-west tracking : pros and cons pg 64
	-efficiency : optical losses around 12% + thermal losses
	-HTF is Therminol VP-1 : synthetic oil : what about using storage molten salt as HTF also ? (Molten salt as HTF under investigation pg58)

Solar field : totality of collector and arrangement on plant ground 
	-graph of irradiance aperture depending on orientationn and time of the year pg 65
	-typical plant of capacity around 30 to 80MW
	- usually 4 columns of collector loops with each colum containing 30 to 40 loops, the loops are around (300m long)
	- size of solar field depends on total solar field fround area which depends on aperture area and distance between rows
	- we can approximate the aperture area which depends on rated power capacity, available direct solar radiation, efficiency and economic optimization 
	- we need a reference irradiance as design point 
		- if peak irradiance : which is reached only few times in summer, 
					than the power block is nearly always operated under part-
					load conditions, which reduces the power block efficiency ==> to low thermal energy for steam
		- if weak radiation condition : then the solar field gets very large (which
					raises the investment costs) and it will happen more frequently that thermal energy from the
					solar field cannot be used in the power block and has to be dumped ==> to much thermal power
	==> Simulations concerning a specific 50MW plant in southern Spain rendered the result that the optimal design direct
		collector irradiance corresponds to the value that has a frequency distribution of 55-60%. which for the considered location was at 650-700W/m²

	- formula for aperture area : A = P * SM / eta * G
		where P : rated power 
			SM : somar multiple
			eta : efficiency
			G : direct irradiance on collector aperture
	- The global horizontal irradiance (GHI) falling onto the Earth’s surface consists of the diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) from the sky and the direct normal irradiance (DNI) from the sun     GHI = DHI + DNI*cos(θ)


In ouf case if we have a storage, we can afford to have a bit larger field in order to accumulate the heat in storage ? 

SM = thermal power of solar field at design point/required thermal power for the full loead operated power block
