# LENVI2007 CSP-Project
---

## Objective

**Project done by :** Anthony Chung, Louis Gouders, Augustin Lambotte, Amaury Laridon 

The goal of this project is to design a Concentrate Solar Panel Plant for a specific agro-food industry established in the South of Spain near Granada. The plant has to be design in order to meet the electricity and heat needs for the industry.
All informations about the project are available in the instructions *APP_CSP_2023.pdf*

To model this project we use the SAM (System Advisor Model) software

## Organisation of the repository 

- The *CSP_notebook.ipynb* contains the main script used to realise the thermal cycle and solar field design.

- The *Granada_msg-iodc_30_2019.csv* is the weather data based on the location of Granada used for the design as well as the SAM simulation.

- The SAM script for our simulation as well as the results are in the *SAM Simulation* folder

- The *References* folder contains the reference book used for this project and the instructions.

- The *Thermal Cycle* folder contains python script used for the thermal cycle sizing.
